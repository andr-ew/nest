# readme notes

```
build personalized interfaces as a waypoint into existing musical processes (a sampler, a synth voice, a sequence)

you're welcome to think about nest as a full-blown library, a configuration language, or a maiden scriptable application in the vein of grid ops

while you can certainly build gridless/arcless applications in nest (i'll be doing this), most designs are simple enough not to really warrant a complex library. nest is an **input focused** syntax, and shines most when syncronizing many forms of interaction data
